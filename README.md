Our startup offers a comprehensive solution to the pressing issue of waste management.Most of the recyclable waste goes in landfills, we aim at reducing that number.

Our solution
We aim at creating the system using which people can provide their recyclable waste(for now only paper waste) to us in exchange of gifts and cash prizes
Recyclable waste goes through 4 mediators before it is finally sold to recycling companies.we aim to directly sell the waste to companies in bulk hence maximizing profit.

Our business model
Creating an app for the customers using which they can enter the amount of waste they can and we will come to collect it
Then we will store the waste in warehouses and sell it in bulk directly to large recycling companies.
Administrator will have a web portal using which they can track all the profit and amount of different kinds of waste people sell in large numbers. Hence analyse trends and try to maximize profit
